Different works for sign language recognition are based on different languages, for example, English, German, Turkish. Since our main goal is to make a prototype of working solution, it is important to choose solutions for specified language dataset.

WLASL2000 Dataset is a American Sign Language with a vocabulary size of 2000 words. It is a challenging dataset collected from web videos performed by 119 signers. It contains 21,083 samples with unconstrained recording conditions. The dataset is imbalanced and the average samples per video are much lower than the above two datasets.
